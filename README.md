Hey, my name is Ethan Johnson, and you've stumbled accross my GitHub!
Feel free to look through my coding projects.
I have coded programs in C#, Java, and C++ (All of my C++ projects were simple and for personal use, and they were created before I saw the value of source control).

Currently employed by [iDTech](https://www.idtech.com) as a tutor for CS related fields.

Thanks for your interest!
