Hey, my name is Ethan Johnson, and you've stumbled accross my GitHub!
Feel free to look through my coding projects.
I have coded programs in C#, Java, and C++ (All of my C++ projects were simple and for personal use, and they were created before I saw the value of source control).

I earned my Bachelors in Computer Game Design and Development at Kennesaw State University! Go owls!
